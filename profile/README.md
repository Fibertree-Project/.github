# Fibertree Project

This organization contains repositories associated with the
**fibertree** tensor abstraction, which can be used to express and
visualize operations on multi-dimensional tensors, e.g., for tensor
algebraic manipulations, in a format-agnostic manner. See the
[fibertree repository](https://github.com/Fibertree-Project/fibertree)
for more information.
